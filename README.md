# ASFALIS
This platform allows the Verification of the veracity of drugs and vaccines using the Ethereum Blockchain on a national and global scale.

# PROBLEM ENVISAGED ?
All over the world, there are drugs that are banned because of known risks for health security.
Some drugs that are already authorized end up being prohibited because of the detection of unwanted effects after a few months of their invention, however there are pharmacies that ignore these bans and continue to market them, or even cases where companies pharmaceuticals are testing their drugs in third world countries without approval WHO prior.
Consequently, a simple consumer cannot verify whether a drug is validated by the competent authorities and may end up using prohibited drugs.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION !
Health care is a delicate sector that requires a great deal of caution, which is why it is essential that the data relating to this field are compliant and considered valid.
The characteristics of the blockchain, including transparency and integrity, make it the ideal platform to develop a solution used by end users to check the veracity of drugs.
Our solution will therefore allow users to check the veracity of drugs using blockchain technology that will provide security and transparency of information, this which guarantees trust among users.
