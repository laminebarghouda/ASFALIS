# ASFALIS
This platform allows the Verification of the veracity of drugs and vaccines using the Ethereum Blockchain on a national and global scale.

# PROBLEM ENVISAGED ?
All over the world, there are drugs that are banned because of known risks for health security.
Some drugs that are already authorized end up being prohibited because of the detection of unwanted effects after a few months of their invention, however there are pharmacies that ignore these bans and continue to market them, or even cases where companies pharmaceuticals are testing their drugs in third world countries without approval WHO prior.
Consequently, a simple consumer cannot verify whether a drug is validated by the competent authorities and may end up using prohibited drugs.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION !
Health care is a delicate sector that requires a great deal of caution, which is why it is essential that the data relating to this field are compliant and considered valid.
The characteristics of the blockchain, including transparency and integrity, make it the ideal platform to develop a solution used by end users to check the veracity of drugs.
Our solution will therefore allow users to check the veracity of drugs using blockchain technology that will provide security and transparency of information, this which guarantees trust among users.

# PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
